# Time use Analysis of daily activities before and during COVID-19

## Project Summary:

### Background:

The treatment of elderly people with chronic health conditions has been a focus in health science literature over the last few decades. However, the analysis of how these individuals spend their time during the day is missing from the literature. Without this understanding, it is difficult to come up with interventions to help these individuals over the long term. 

### Aims:

The aim of this project is to develop an understanding of how elderly individuals with chronic health conditions spend their time. This may assist with the development of new health interventions for these individuals. 

### Data:

The data was presented to us in Microsoft Excel as individual data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The individual data presents ten minute slots that document what primary/secondary activities each individual patient was engaging in that ten minute timeframe before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. We then aggregated the data to simplify the individual data by summing and outlining the activity lengths for subject.

### Value of our Research:

Our analysis will help the researcher understand what interventions will most effectively help elderly people with chronic health conditions in the future. It will also provide information on how public health events such as pandemics affect the lives of vulnerable individuals.
